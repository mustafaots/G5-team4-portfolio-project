## 🧩 Team Retrospective

### 📘 Project Overview
This team portfolio project was our first real experience working collaboratively with GitHub.  
It felt like a glimpse into how professional software teams operate — using structured workflows, communicating regularly, and learning how to handle version control as a group.

---

### 🔧 Workflow Implementation
We adopted the **GitHub feature-branch workflow**, setting up a `develop` branch from `main`.  
Each member created their own feature branch to work independently on their section of the project.  
This allowed everyone to contribute in parallel without stepping on each other’s code early on.

---

### 🔍 Code Review Process
The **pull request** system was one of the most valuable aspects of this project.  
What began as simple merging quickly turned into genuine peer review.  
Team members gave feedback on both the content and structure of each other’s work, helping us improve code quality and learn from one another.

---

### 💬 Communication Strategy
We relied on:
- **Slack** for real-time discussions  
- **Jira** for task tracking and progress management  

Team members made it a habit to:
- Announce when pull requests were ready  
- Discuss potential conflicts before they became real issues  

This approach kept the workflow smooth and transparent.

---

### ⚙️ Challenges and Solutions
Our biggest challenge was managing **merge conflicts**, especially in shared files like `index.html` and `styles.css`.

**Solutions we implemented:**
- Gave clear ownership of core files  
- Pulled the latest changes before starting new work  
- Committed small, frequent updates  
- Coordinated better on shared edits  

These simple practices saved us significant time and avoided confusion.

---

### 💡 Key Lessons and Future Improvements
We learned that **communication** and **consistent version control habits** are the backbone of team projects.  
For future collaborations, we plan to:
- Define the project structure early  
- Use consistent branch naming conventions  
- Track tasks directly through GitHub Issues  
- Set clear “done” criteria for pull requests  
- Hold regular sync meetings to address integration challenges  

---

### 🏁 Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great success.  
We improved our technical skills, strengthened teamwork, and gained confidence in real-world development workflows.  
These lessons will undoubtedly guide us in future software engineering endeavors.
